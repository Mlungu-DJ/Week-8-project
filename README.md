📝 Project Title:
COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

📄 Short Description:
This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using real-world data from Our World in Data. It tracks total cases, deaths, new infections, and vaccination progress across selected countries. The final product is a data-driven notebook that combines code, visualizations, and narrative insights suitable for sharing or publishing.

🎯 Objectives of the Project:
✅ Import and clean COVID-19 data from a trusted source.

✅ Analyze time trends for total cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

✅ Compare key metrics between multiple countries.

✅ Visualize trends using clear, insightful charts and maps.

✅ Summarize findings with narrative insights in a Jupyter Notebook.

🧰 Tools and Libraries Used:
Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

pandas – data manipulation and cleaning

matplotlib – static visualizations

seaborn – enhanced statistical plots

plotly.express – interactive choropleth maps (optional)

▶️ How to Run/View the Project:
Download the dataset:

owid-covid-data.csv

Save it in the same directory as the notebook.

Open the notebook using Jupyter or VS Code with the Jupyter extension.

Run each cell sequentially to execute the analysis.

Optional: Export the final notebook as PDF or HTML:

In Jupyter: File > Download as > PDF via LaTeX or HTML (.html)

💡 Insights & Reflections:
India experienced the highest cumulative cases among the selected countries.

United States saw multiple high peaks in daily infections, especially during winter surges.

Kenya had a slower but steady vaccination campaign, with lower total case counts.

The death rate varied between countries, possibly reflecting differences in healthcare infrastructure and pandemic response strategies.

Visual tools like 7-day rolling averages and choropleth maps helped reveal hidden patterns and made the data easier to understand.
